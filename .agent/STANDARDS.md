# Project Standards

## Design Philosophy

See `DESIGN-PHILOSOPHY.md` for the tiered principle system (14 principles across 3 tiers) that guides all architectural decisions. When principles conflict, refer to the tension resolution table.

## Critical Rules

> **See `../CLAUDE.md` § Critical Rules** — that file is the canonical source.
> Do not duplicate the rules here.

## TypeScript Standards

- Strict mode enabled, all strict flags on
- ES2022 target, NodeNext module resolution
- ESM-only (no CommonJS)
- No `any` types — use `unknown` for truly unknown
- Declaration maps and source maps required
- Node.js >= 20.0.0

## Code Quality

- Keep functions small and focused (P9: Composability)
- Prefer explicit over implicit (P5: Least Surprise)
- Handle errors at boundaries, never swallow silently (P2: No Silent Degradation)
- Write self-documenting code
- Return errors, don't throw them (see `patterns/error-handling.md`)

## API Design

- Same inputs produce same outputs (P5: Least Surprise)
- Write operations are idempotent (P8: Idempotency)
- Surface confidence and method, not just results (P10: Honest Uncertainty)
- Simple case simple, scale detail with complexity (P7: Progressive Disclosure)
- See `patterns/api-design.md` for full guidance

## Package Publishing

- All packages published under `@centient` npm scope
- Use Changesets for versioning — never bump versions manually
- Turbo orchestrates build order via `dependsOn: ["^build"]`
- WAL depends on logger (workspace protocol)

## Testing

- Vitest for all TypeScript packages
- Co-locate tests with source or in `tests/` directory
- Integration tests excluded from default run (vitest.config.ts)
- Coverage via @vitest/coverage-v8

## Cost Awareness (P11)

- Caching and deduplication are requirements, not optimizations
- Batch repeated operations instead of N+1 calls
- Track external API costs

## Documentation

- Update docs when changing behavior
- Record architectural decisions in ADRs, reference principles by number
- Keep README current
- Update CHANGELOG via changesets
