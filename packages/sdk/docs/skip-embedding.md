# Skip-embedding optimization (`skipEmbedding`)

`crystals.update` accepts an optional `skipEmbedding: boolean` parameter that tells the server to commit the update **without** regenerating the crystal's embedding. The persisted embedding stays at its previous value; subsequent semantic search returns the (now-stale) prior content.

This is a **compute-cost optimization** for high-frequency updates where the new content is not meaningful to semantic search — heartbeats, lock holders, last-seen timestamps, counters, status flags. Misuse on content-bearing fields silently degrades search quality without surfacing an error.

## Quick start

```typescript
import { createEngramClient } from "@centient/sdk";

const client = createEngramClient();

// Heartbeat update — runs every few seconds. The embedding is meaningless
// for this content, so skip the regen and reclaim the LLM compute.
await client.crystals.update(instanceCrystalId, {
  contentInline: JSON.stringify({ lastHeartbeat: new Date().toISOString() }),
  skipEmbedding: true,
});
```

When `skipEmbedding` is omitted (or `false`), today's behaviour is preserved: every update regenerates the embedding.

## When to use

✅ **Good fits:**
- Heartbeat / liveness timestamps written by long-running daemons
- Lock-holder fields with rapid contention
- Counters (request count, error count, retry count)
- Status flags (`active` / `paused` / `draining`)
- Bookkeeping metadata that no one searches semantically

❌ **Don't use for:**
- Anything a user might type a query about
- Content fields (titles, descriptions, body text)
- Tags or categories that participate in faceted search
- Any field where retrieval quality matters

## Composes with `expectedVersion`

Both flags are independent:

```typescript
// Atomic CAS update + embedding skip — typical for maintainer's
// heartbeat write that must not race with a peer's lock takeover.
await client.crystals.update(instanceCrystalId, {
  contentInline: JSON.stringify({ lastHeartbeat: now, holder: instanceId }),
  expectedVersion: localVersion,
  skipEmbedding: true,
});
```

CAS is still enforced server-side. The embedding is still skipped on success.

## Server requirements

Requires engram-server with `skipEmbedding` support on `PATCH /crystals/:id` (sibling issue [centient-labs/engram-server#65](https://github.com/centient-labs/engram-server/issues/65)).

**Older servers silently ignore the field** — the optimization becomes a no-op (embedding regenerates as before). Correctness is unaffected; only the compute saving is lost. This is intentional: it lets the SDK ship the optimization without coordinating a flag-day server upgrade. To verify your server supports it, gate startup on `client.checkCompatibility()` and require the engram-server version that landed engram-server#65 (TBD until it ships).

## What `skipEmbedding` does NOT do

- It does not delete the existing embedding. Searches continue to return the crystal at its old embedding.
- It does not skip the version bump. `vaultVersion`/`version` still increments per the server's normal semantics.
- It does not skip audit-trail emission. Every update flows through the server's standard observability.
- It does not skip integrity checks (CAS, validation, ACL).

## Background

This is **ADR-017 OQ#2** in the maintainer planning docs. Maintainer's instance-heartbeat pattern writes `lastHeartbeat` every few seconds; without `skipEmbedding`, every write would trigger a 50–100ms LLM call to regenerate the embedding for content nobody searches semantically. With `skipEmbedding: true`, that compute is reclaimed entirely.
